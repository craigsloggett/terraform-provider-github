# GitHub Provider

The GitHub provider is used to interact with resources supported by
GitHub. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials
before it can be used.

## Authentication

The GitHub provider currently only supports the use of a personal access token
to authenticate with the GitHub API.

### Personal Access Token

To authenticate using a fine-grained personal access token, ensure that the
`token` argument or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set.

```terraform
provider "github" {
  token = var.github_token # Or the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable.
}
```

- `token` (String) The GitHub fine-grained personal access token used to authenticate with the API. Alternatively, can be configured using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
